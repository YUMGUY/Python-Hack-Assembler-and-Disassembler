# Python-Hack-Assembler-and-Disassembler

I coded a 16-bit machine language assembler and disassembler for the 16-bit Hack Assembly language.

The disassembler converts 16-bit machine code into the matching hack assembly language.


Open the file in a personal IDE:

To run the Assembler:
It will prompt the user to input in the name of the .asm file.
Then it will output a .hack file of the same name
The .hack file will contain the correct machine code.
For e.g testfile.asm as the input will output testfile.hack

To run the disassembler:
It will prompt the user to input the name of the .hack file.
Then it will output a .asm file of the same name.
The .asm file will contain the Hack assembly code for the machine code in the .hack file.
